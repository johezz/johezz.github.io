    "text": "Hi! I‚Äôm Jo. I‚Äôm currently a 4th year PhD student at Columbia University. I‚Äôm part of the Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Lab (PI: Kevin Ochsner) and Couples Lab (PI: Niall Bolger).\nI‚Äôm broadly interested in the link between social relationships and emotional experiences. I‚Äôm particularly interested in how we regulate others‚Äô emotions in a variety of contexts: what representations are we drawing upon to respond to others? I enjoy learning from a variety of literatures to inform my research: emotion regulation, close relationships, mentalizing, attachment, development etc., and I am also curious about understanding these phenomena at the level of brain and behavior. As my interests evolve over time, the publications page may be helpful in offering a concrete sense of what I‚Äôve been thinking about.\nUltimately, I hope that my work can not only inform basic science, but also contribute to interventions that can help everyone build better relationships and well-being."
