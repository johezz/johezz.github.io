Hi!

I am a psychologist and neuroscientist interested in the social nature of emotion regulation.

Currently, I am working with [Dr. Kevin Ochsner](https://www.ochsnerscanlab.org/) and [Dr. Niall Bolger](https://columbiacoupleslab.weebly.com/) at Columbia University.

This website is a work in progress. Please feel free to reach out!
