Hi! I'm Jo. I'm currently a 4th year PhD student at Columbia University. I'm part of the [Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Lab](https://www.ochsnerscanlab.org/) (PI: Kevin Ochsner) and [Couples Lab](https://columbiacoupleslab.weebly.com/) (PI: Niall Bolger).

I'm broadly interested in the link between social relationships and emotional experiences. I'm particularly interested in how we regulate others' emotions in a variety of contexts: what representations are we drawing upon to respond to others? I enjoy learning from a variety of literatures to inform my research: emotion regulation, close relationships, mentalizing, attachment, development etc., and I am also curious about understanding these phenomena at the level of brain and behavior. As my interests evolve over time, the [publications page](https://johezz.github.io/publications.html) may be helpful in offering a concrete sense of what I've been thinking about.

Ultimately, I hope that my work can not only inform basic science, but also contribute to interventions that can help everyone build better relationships and well-being.
